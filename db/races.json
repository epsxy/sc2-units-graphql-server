    "description": "With their highly advanced technology and potent psionic abilities, the Protoss once considered themselves the most powerful species in the galaxy. The Protoss have never been a prolific people and have traditionally bolstered their numbers with a variety of robotic war machines. Individual Protoss warriors are unsurpassed in their skills, greatly enhanced by the combination of technology and formidable psionic strength.",

    "name": "Terran",
    "description": "The Terrans are relative newcomers to the Koprulu sector. They are the descendents of a disastrous colonization expedition launched from Earth centuries ago. Its human cargo made up of dissidents and malcontents the ruling Earth government deemed expendable. The survivors of the expedition established three colonies that became the basis for the major power blocs in Terran space: the Confederacy, the Kel-Morian Combine, and the Umojan Protectorate. The corrupt Confederacy was overthrown by terrorist and revolutionary Arcturus Mengsk during the chaos of the Zerg invasion. Now the Terran Dominion has emerged from the ashes of the old Confederacy as the dominant power, ruled by none other than Emperor Arcturus I.",

    "name": "Zerg",
    "description": "The Zerg are a race entirely unlike the Terrans or the Protoss. They are composed of many different species integrated into the Swarm via Zerg infestation. These creatures are rapidly and selectively evolved into deadly and efficient killers to further the driving Zerg imperative of achieving absolute domination. The Zerg make no use of technology to create their weapons, armor, or starships. Instead, these functions are efficiently fulfilled through biological adaptation and planned mutation of the Zerg strains. Even Zerg buildings are in fact specialized organs within the living, growing organism of a Zerg nest.",
